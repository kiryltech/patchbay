# patchbay

Patchbay is a local, privacy-first control plane for manually routing and patching context between AI web sessions and official APIs.

It enables hybrid workflows that combine UI-only capabilities (e.g. Deep Research, Canvas) with fast, stable API-based execution—without running a backend.
